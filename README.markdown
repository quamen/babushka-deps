# Babushka Deps

I bought a new computer, I'm going to build it entirely with babushka, and then re-install everything and do it again. As many times as necessary to convince myself that it all works.3

If you want to replicate my setup:

    babushka quamen:*

## Some useful Babushka Deps you might want to try out

Install rvm with 1.9.2, 1.8.7, ree and macruby. Setting 1.9.2 as the default ruby.
